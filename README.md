**ðŸš€ Generative AI: Intro and Applications**

I learned about the evolution, core concepts, and real-world applications of Generative AI. This included foundational models like GANs, VAEs, and transformers, which enable creative AI capabilitiesâ€”from generating images, text, and audio to synthesizing code and building virtual environments. I also gained hands-on experience applying Generative AI in practical scenarios.

In Module 2, I explored how Generative AI is actively transforming industries such as IT, DevOps, healthcare, finance, and HR, driving innovation and improving efficiency. I worked with text, image, and code generation tools, gaining practical exposure to real-world AI applications.

Throughout the course, I deepened my understanding of how generative models create new contentâ€”text, images, audio, video, and codeâ€”based on the data theyâ€™re trained on. I explored tools like:

**ChatGPT and Gemini for dynamic text generation**

**DALLÂ·E, Stable Diffusion, and StyleGAN for prompt-based image creation**

**GitHub Copilot, PolyCoder, and IBM Watson Code Assistant for accelerating code development**

This experience has equipped me with a solid grasp of Generative AIâ€™s core principles and its real-world impact across multiple domains.
