# Generative-AI-Intro-and-Application
I learned about the evolution, core concepts, and real-world applications of Generative AI. I explored how models like GANs, VAEs, and transformers power creative AI capabilities—from generating images, text, and audio to synthesizing code and building virtual environments. I also gained hands-on experience applying Generative AI in practical scenarios.
In module 2, I explored how Generative AI is transforming industries—from IT and DevOps to healthcare, finance, and HR—by making work more efficient and innovative. I got hands-on with tools for text, image, and code generation, gaining practical experience with real-world applications.
This course is all about the core principles of Generative AI—from how these models work to their real-world impact across various industries. I learned that generative models can create new content such as text, images, audio, video, and code, all based on the data they’re trained on. I discovered how tools like ChatGPT and Gemini enhance communication through dynamic text generation, while DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, and StyleGAN make realistic image creation possible with simple prompts. I also explored how platforms like GitHub Copilot, PolyCoder, and IBM Watson Code Assistant are streamlining code development.
